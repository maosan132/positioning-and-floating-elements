                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a
                        new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                        venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                        created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                        with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
                        itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                        faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                    <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                        detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                    <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
                        it.</p>

                    <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                        right.</p>
                    <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
                        telescopes at the
                        South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
                        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational
                            waves</a> — the
                        signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
                        trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

                    <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
                        wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                    <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
                        discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open
                        vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                    <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in
                        space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
                        cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
                        there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
                        pasta water boiling over.</p>

                    <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever
                        beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
                        Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
                        according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                    <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the
                        team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                    <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                        gravitational waves.”</p>
                    <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                        permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
                        as the surface of the sun.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging
                        of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
                        Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical

                            is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
                            observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                            Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                            has cooled.

                            exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every

                            solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the
                            Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
                            violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the
                            universe.

                            Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized
                            light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe.
                            These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

                            cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the
                            structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

                        analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work
                        to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
                        Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who
                        chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
                    <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
                        inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean
                        last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a

                    <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
                    <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not
                        think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,”
                        Dr. Linde wrote in an email.</p>
                    <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                        “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
                    <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                        spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
                    <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
                        will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
                    <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                        project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the
                        results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.</p>
                    <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a
                        pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate
                        his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
                    <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
                        that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                        background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the
                        universe.</p>
                    <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
                    <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings
                        this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
                        mountaintops and space.</p>
                    <p class="bigger">Spirals in the Sky</p>
                    <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which
                        were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
                        won the Nobel Prize.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
                        leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the
                        South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement
                        Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and
                        Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
                    <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said.
                        He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
                        said.</p>

                    <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
                        meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                    </p>
                    <p>This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation.
                        Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would
                        twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
                        polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
                    <p>Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature
                        of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
                        thermometer.</p>
                    <p>“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
                    <p>The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
                        Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
                        beat them to the breakthrough.</p>
                    <p class="bigger">A Special Time </p>
                    <p>The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late
                        in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                        universe.</p>
                    <p>Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and
                        strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                        manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest
                        moments.</p>
                    <p>As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
                        mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one
                        force after another splitting away.</p>
                    <p>That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                    <p>Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
                        degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case,
                        space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                    <p>Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
                        universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
                        space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                    <p>What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
                        from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
                        cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                    <p>Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All
                        of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of
                        sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
                        free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
                    <p>Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
                        vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down
                        to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off
                        other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
                    <p>So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going
                        any deeper into the past.</p>
                    <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
                        erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
                        swept away, forever out of our view.</p>
                    <p>“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not
                        part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
